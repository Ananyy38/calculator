**Reflection on Using Aider for Calculator Enhancements**

**1. Most Effective Aider Techniques Discovered**

* **Targeted Prompting:** Crafting clear, step-by-step Aider commands (e.g. “Create a toggle button in App.js…”) led to precise code changes without manual boilerplate.
* **Component Generation:** Asking Aider to scaffold new components (like `History.js`) saved setup time and ensured consistent props usage.
* **Thematic Refactoring:** Using commands to apply theme-based CSS classes across multiple files (“Modify files so that numbers invert colors in dark mode”) streamlined the dark-mode implementation.

**2. Limitations Encountered**

* **Context Scope:** Aider occasionally missed inter-file dependencies (e.g. forgetting to import `useState`), requiring manual fixes.
* **Complex Logic Handling:** While good for UI wiring and simple state, Aider struggled with nuanced calculation logic (edge cases like chained operations), so we still hand-tuned the core algorithm.
* **Overflow/Layout Tweaks:** Automated layout fixes sometimes introduced new overflows, meaning CSS needed manual adjustment beyond Aider’s initial patch.

**3. Comparison to Traditional Coding Workflow**

* **Speed:** Aider compressed routine tasks (component stubs, CSS class toggling, prop wiring) into seconds rather than minutes, boosting productivity.
* **Cognitive Load:** Offloading repetitive edits let me concentrate on core logic and UX refinements, whereas manual refactoring demands shifting attention across files.
* **Review Overhead:** Despite Aider’s quick output, every change still required code review. Traditional coding for these tasks would be slower but more predictably correct on first pass.

**4. Suggestions for Improving Aider for Similar Tasks**

* **Global State Awareness:** Enhancing Aider’s ability to analyze entire codebases would reduce missing imports and mismatched state variables.
* **Logic Validation Prompts:** Integrating simple test-generation commands (e.g. “Add unit tests for chained operations”) could catch algorithm gaps automatically.
* **Interactive Layout Previews:** If Aider could render quick layout snapshots (even text-based), it would help identify overflow or styling issues before manual tweaking.

Overall, Aider proved a powerful assistant for UI scaffolding, theming, and repetitive edits, dramatically accelerating development. The main gaps lie in deeper logic understanding and holistic code-context awareness—areas where traditional coding and manual review remain essential.
